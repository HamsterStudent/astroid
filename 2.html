    <p><strong>Pavel Andreievich Chekov (In Russian Павел Андреевич Чеков)</strong> was a Human who served as a Starfleet officer during the latter half of the 23rd century. Although he mainly served as the navigator and security chief aboard the USS Enterprise and the USS Enterprise-A, he played a more variable role than other senior crew members under Captain James T. Kirk. (Star Trek: The Original Series; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier; Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)<p></p>
