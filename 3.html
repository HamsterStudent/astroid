      <h3> Montgomery Scott</h3>

      <strong>Montgomery Scott (often referred to as Scotty by his shipmates)</strong> was a male Human Starfleet officer in the 23rd century. His serial number was SE 19754 T. For a period of nearly thirty years, he was the chief engineer of both the USS Enterprise and the USS Enterprise-A, both under the command of Captain James T. Kirk. Having the reputation as a "miracle worker", he was a man of superior technical and engineering skill, experience and ingenuity. Despite his superior talents as an engineer, he was often the source of comic relief among the Enterprise crew due to his use of Scots language.<p></p>
